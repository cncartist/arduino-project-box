# arduino-project-box
The LCD-Temperature-Humidity code is uploaded to the Arduino UNO and ran in conjunction with the Arduino project box setup posted on thingiverse (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1520159).

It's fully functional and commented.  I use this Arduino project box for temperature/humidity sensing for my 3D printer build area & filament dry box.  If you have any improvements or additions, feel free to modify it!
